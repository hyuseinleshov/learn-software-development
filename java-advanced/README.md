# Java Advanced Concepts ðŸš€

This project contains advanced Java concepts that I am exploring.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
- âœ… Sealed Classes and Interfaces â€“ Sealing allows classes and interfaces to define their permitted subtypes
- âœ… Dependency Injection in Java â€“ Design pattern that promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies instead of creating them within a class, improving flexibility and testability
